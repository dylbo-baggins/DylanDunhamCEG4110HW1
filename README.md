# What this is
This is a simple android application that has a writing activity that randomly changes the color of text and displays the color value. There is also the drawing activity where a user can draw with their finger with any color and save the drawing as an image on their phone.

# Special Deployment
There is no special deployment, just make sure that the app has its one storage permission in your app settings.

# Instructions for use:
Below is the main menu. From here you can pick the writing or drawing activity by selecting the appropriate button. Taping the return button returns to the main menu.

Next is the write activity. Users can tap on the text field to write something with the android keyboard. Then if they tap the change color button, the text will change color and the color values will be displayed below the button. Taping the return button returns to the main menu.

Finally, there is the draw activity. The user can draw images on the canvas which is located below the buttons on the top of the screen by dragging their finger on it. Tapping the color select button will pull up a color select screen to choose a new color. Tapping the clear button will clear the canvas. If the app has permission, tapping the save button will save the image into a new album created by the app and should be viewable by the native android gallery viewer. Taping the return button returns to the main menu.
